    """
    Extract newick rooted trees from a text file.
    The function extract lines begining with an open parenthesis and
    closing with a semicolon and interpret them as newick strings.
    The first argument is the path of the file, but the function can be used
    without any argument. In this case, a file selection window appears.
    A taxa bloc can also be present to replace taxa names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile : str
        Path of the file containing rooted trees in newick format
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format). The input file must
        contain a single newick string on each line. Whitespaces are not
        allowed for leaf names.
        Example:

            (a,b,(c,d,(e,f)));
            ((c,e),(a,(b,(d,f))));

    taxa_replacement : bool, optional
        Path of a table file containing two columns. The first column
        corresponds to the names of the terminals of the newick stored in
        infile, and the second column corresponds to their names the user wants
        to obtain at the end. All separators accepted. Example:
             AA Diceras
             AB Valletia
             AC Monopleura
        The default is False (no replacement).
    info_tree : bool, optional
        Option that discard non-informative trees (at least, two terminals that 
        are closer together relatively to a third one) when activated.
        The default is True (non-informative trees are discarded).

    Returns
    -------
    character_dict : dict
        Dictionnary containing trees in keys with indices in values.

    """
    Function that build ete3 trees from a file containing a hierarchical
    matrix (or several matrices). The matrix must be a table text
    (e.g., a csv file). The separator cannot be a comma.

    Format of the matrix:

      * The first line corresponds to the hierarchical structure of the
        character tree with labels.
        It is a newick tree without ending semicolon and without leaves.
        It is to the user to choose which nodes are labelled. Labels must be
        integers.

        Examples: (0(1)), (0(1)(2(3(4)))), ((0)(1)).

      * The first column corresponds to taxa names. Semicolons cannot be used
        in a name. The first cell is empty as it corresponds to the line
        of hierarchical characters.

      * The following lines are identical to those of a standard
        taxon/character matrix. Each state corresponds to the branching
        position of a specific taxon on the character.
        Each cell can be filled by:

            - A question mark "?" if the state for a taxon is unknown.

            - An integer which should be mandatory present in the first line
              of the matrix. For example, if the character is coded as (0,(1))
              by the user, only 0 and 1 can be used.

            - In case of polymorphism (if the user want to branch several
              instances of the same taxon in several nodes), the several
              integers must be separated by a comma ",".

        Example:

            ;(0,(1));(0,(1));(0,(1,(2)));(0,(1,(2),(3)))
            Diceras;0;0;0;0

            Clinocaprina;1;1;1;3
            Vaccinites;0,1;1;2;3


    Parameters
    ----------
    infilelist : list
        List of paths of files containing hierarchical matrices.
    prefix : str, optional
        Prefix of the file to save. If prefix is set to false, no file is
        saved. The default is False.
    chardec : bool, optional
        If true, decompose each tree into components (one tree for each
        informative node). The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    character_dict : dict
        Dictionnary containing trees in keys with indices in values.

    analysis

    Main function of the Agatta python package. Allow to perform a three-item
    analysis, e.g., in the context of systematics phylogenetics, using
    hierarchical characters, or in cladistic biogeography. The cladogram(s)
    obtained by congruence is the tree that maximises the amount of hypotheses
    of cladistic relationships (i.e., the three-item statements) deduced from
    the input trees (the characters).
    The analysis can be performed using a text file containing a hierarchical
    matrix (see section mandatory parameters below for informations about
    the format) or newick rooted trees encoded in a newick, nexus, or nexml
    file.
    There are no constraints on the input trees excepted that they must
    be rooted to perform the analysis. If they are repeated leaves
    (polymorphism), they are automatically removed (several methods
    are implemented, see below).
    Several options are available for analysing the results: the user can
    compute a consensus when several cladograms are optimal, a specific
    character-state testing procedure can be used to test whether each
    character state (i.e., each informative node of a tree) is a synapomorphy
    or an homoplasy, and finally a retention index can be computed to
    obtained the proportion of phylogenetic relationships of characters
    that have been retained in the optimal cladogram.

    Usage:

        agatta analysis <file> [-s -v --analysis=<type> --chartest
                                      --consensus=<type> --parallel=<int>

                                      --repetitions=<type> --replicates=<int>
                                      --ri --rosetta=<file> --softpath=<path>
                                      --software=<type> --taxarep1=<path>
                                      --weighting=<type> --detailed_tripdec]

        Mandatory parameters:

            <file> Path of the file containing the character trees.
            The trees can be encoded for Agatta in a file in several ways:
              - a hierarchical matrix,
              - A newick file with a single newick tree on each line,
              - A nexus file (extension in .nex),
              - A nexml file (extension in .nexml).
            THe following url give more information on how to build input
            files: URL.

        Optionnal parameters:

            -s  Silent mode.
            -v  Verbose mode.
            --analysis=<type>  Type of tree search analysis between an exact
            branch and bound ('bandb') or an heuristic tree search
            ('heuristic'). The heuristic search is only available through
            PAUP*, TNT, and WQFM, thus it is mandatory to add the flag
            --software=tnt, --software=paup, or --software=wqfm (and the flag
            --softpath accordingly).
            By default the analysis is in branch and bound below 15 terminals
            and heuristic otherwise.
            --chartest  Test and locates all character states on the cladogram.
            Each character state can be a synapomorphy if the hypothesis is
            accepted or an homoplasy if the hypothesis of sameness is rejected.
            Two output files are writen: prefix.chartest gives all locations
            of the states on the cladogram and if the test is passed or not,
            sorted by state, and prefix.chartest_node gives the same
            information sorted by node.
            --consensus=<type>  Compute a consensus which can be a strict
            consensus ('strict') or a reduced cladistic consensus ('rcc',
            Wilkinson 1994) which is able to detect more common information
            in subtrees. By default, the flag without argument produces a
            strict consensus. The output file is prefix.constrict or
            prefix.rcc.
            --parallel=<type>  Option for choosing if the analysis is made
            using multiprocessing or not. This argument can be:
              - 'not' if the user does not wan to use multiprocessing.
              - 'auto' for automatic detection of the number of cpu.
              - any integer corresponding to the number of cpu allowed.
            By default, the analysis is made in parallel using all available
            cpu. This option can be used in the case of very large character
            tree that can saturate the RAM if too many parallel processing are
            active.
            --pdf  Compute a pdf file to visualise character states on
            the cladogram if --chartest is used. One page for each state is
            writen. The file is named prefix.pdf.
            --prefix=<file>  Prefix of all saving files. The complete path can
            be used. By default, the prefix is 'agatta_out' and all files are
            saved in the directory of the first <file>.
            --repetitions=<type>  The removal of repeated leaves in character
            trees is made using the method of free-paralogy subtree.
            Two algorithms are implemented, the original one from Nelson and
            Ladiges (1996) ('FPS') for dealing with paralogy in cladistic
            biogeography, and the algorithm of Rineau et al. (2021) ('TMS')
            designed for all cases of repetitions (not only paralogy).
            If the flag is not used and if repetitions are detected, they are
            automatically removed using Rineau et al. algorithm's.
            The repetition-free character trees are writen in prefix.poly and
            each new tree receives an id, e.g. 1.2 corresponds to the second
            repetition-free subtree computed from the 1st original character
            tree.
            --replicates=<int>  State the number of replicates in case
            of an heuristic tree search. By default the heuristic search is
            launched with 1000 replicates.
            --ri  Compute the retention index of the resulting cladogram and
            a retention index for each character which states the percentage
            of phylogenetic information retained in the optimal cladogram.
            The results are writen in prefix.ri.
            --rosetta=<file>  If the input tree leaves are parts, cladistics
            requires a standardisation step with replacement of parts to
            wholes. It is especially important in cladistic biogeography where
            terminal taxa are replaced by biogeographic areas. The rosetta flag
            replaces leaves of input trees according to a csv file with its
            path given as argument. The csv file is a table with two columns,
            one with the name of the tree leaves and the second with their
            corresponding names to be switched. The results of the
            standardisation are writen in the file prefix.stand.
            --softpath=<path>  Path of the software declared in --software.
            --software=<type>  Choose how to perform the three-item analysis.
            The analysis can be performed using the built-in branch and bound
            in Agatta ('agatta'). 'paup' and 'tnt' can be used for branch and
            bound or heuristic search. 'wqfm' works only with heuristic.
            By default the analysis is made using built-in branch and bound.
            However it works only with very few terminals.
            User should consider to switch the software is the
            analysis time appears to be too long. A prefix.nex file is
            generated if 'paup', a prefix.tnt file for 'tnt', and a
            prefix.wqfm for 'wqfm'.
            --taxarep1=<path>  If the user wants to replace identifiers by real
            leaf names in the result files, this flag can be used with a path
            to a csv file with two columns, the first with the identifiers in
            the actual newick strings and the other with the names the user
            wants.
            --weighting=<type>  Weighting scheme to use on triplets. The
            type of weighting will change the results of the analysis.
            The following schemes can be used:
                - FW: Fractional weighting from Rineau et al. (2021),
                - FWNL: Fractional weighting from Nelson and Ladiges (1992),
                - UW: Uniform weighting from Nelson and Ladiges (1992),
                - MW: Minimal weighting from Wilkinson et al. (2004),
                - AW: Additive weighting : the weight of a triplet in additive
                  weighting corresponds to the number of trees in which the
                  triplet is present,
                - NW: No weighting (all triplets have a weight of 1).
            By default 'FW' is used.
            --detailed_tripdec Compute a detailed csv table showing the
            link between triplet weights and character trees. Each column 
            corresponds to one character (same order as <file>). Each line 
            corresponds to a triplet. The last column and line give the sum
            of all weights of the column or line, respectively.

    Output:

        Four ouput files are writen all the time when using the analysis
        command in addition to optionnal output files.
        The files are:
          - prefix.log is a log file with all the parameters of the analysis.
          - prefix.triplet is a file with all triplets deduced from the input
            character trees. Each row corresponds to one triplet with its
            weight as a fraction and as a float.
          - prefix.taxabloc is a table file with the correspondance between
            leaf identifiers and names given in the input.
          - prefix.tre is a newick file recording all the optimal cladograms
            found during the analysis.

    support

    The support command gathers several triplet metrics and indices that are
    intended to compare trees between them. The retention index measures the
    amount of cladistic relationships from the input characters retained in
    the optimal cladogram (or a consensus). The triplet distance measures
    the distance in terms of triplets between two trees. The ITRI compares
    in terms of triplets a tree relatively to a reference tree (used to
    measure efficiency of methods using simulations).
    All these metrics handle weighting schemes.

            The trees can be stored in newick files, nexus files (.nex), or
            nexml files (.nexml). Hierarchical matrices are not handled by the
            support command.
            The requested files depend of the --index flag:
                --index=ri: the retention index compares the cladogram to its
                characters. The first <file> contains one tree considered as

                --index=tripdistance: compute various measures for comparison 
                between two trees t1 and t2. Can be used in simulation

            --index  The index flag specifies which measure to use to compare
            rooted trees between retention index ('ri'), or inter-tree 
            retention index/triplet distance ('tripdistance'). More 
            informations on the input file in the mandatory parameters section.
            --taxarep1=<path>  If the user wants to replace identifiers by real

            repetition-free subtree computed from the 1st original character
            tree. 

    Output:

        One ouput file is writen the results of the tree comparisons:
            - For ri, a global retention index stating the overall information
            content of all character trees retained in the cladogram is writen,
            plus a ri for each character, a ri for each character state, and a 
            ri for each subtree if polymorphism allowing to cut tcharacter 
            trees in subtrees present.
            - For tripdistance, several values are computed given two trees t1

    The chartest command is intended to use the character state testing
    procedure for hierarchical characters. Each character state
    (an informative node in a rooted tree) is tested against a cladogram:
    if the test fails, the character state hypothesis (an hypothesis of clade)
    is rejected, and the state becomes homoplasic; otherwise, if the state pass
    the test, it becomes a synapomorphy that supports a specific node of the
    cladogram.

        Mandatory parameters:

            <file> Path of files containing the character trees.
            The trees can be encoded for Agatta in a file in several ways:
              - a hierarchical matrix,
              - A newick file with a single newick tree on each line,
              - A nexus file (extension in .nex),

            --taxarep1=<path>  If the user wants to replace identifiers by real
            leaf names in the result files, this flag can be used with a path

            --repetitions=<type>  The removal of repeated leaves in character
            trees is made using the method of free-paralogy subtree.
            Two algorithms are implemented, the original one from Nelson and
            Ladiges (1996) ('FPS') for dealing with paralogy in cladistic
            biogeography, and the algorithm of Rineau et al. (2021) ('TMS')
            designed for all cases of repetitions (not only paralogy).
            If the flag is not used and if repetitions are detected, they are
            automatically removed using Rineau et al. algorithm's.
            The repetition-free character trees are writen in prefix.poly and
            each new tree receives an id, e.g. 1.2 corresponds to the second
            repetition-free subtree computed from the 1st original character
            tree.
    Output:

            ('heuristic'). A line is writen accordingly in the output file.
            By default the analysis is in branch and bound below 15 terminals
            and heuristic otherwise.
            --filetype=<type>  The input file can be a classic file containing
            newick trees (newick file, nexus file, or nexml file) ('trees'), or
            a list of triplets ('triplets') generated using the Agatta tripdec

              - 'auto' for automatic detection of the number of cpu.
              - any integer corresponding to the number of cpu allowed.
            By default, the analysis is made in parallel using all available
            cpu. This option can be used in the case of very large character

            active.
            --prefix=<file>  Prefix of saving .nex or .tnt file. The complete

            --weighting=<type>  Weighting scheme to use on triplets. The
            type of weighting will change the results of the analysis.

                - AW: Additive weighting : the weight of a triplet in additive
                  weighting corresponds to the number of trees in which the
                  triplet is present,
                - NW: No weighting (all triplets have a weight of 1).
